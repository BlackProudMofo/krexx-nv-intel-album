# The Invite - Lyrics

## Intro
Allow me jonez  
Trabaye  
Allow me vibe, I wan display  
Allow me do, no calculate  
Allow me vibe, Allow me jonez  

## Hook  
Make you lurk in my body  
Hope you open for something  
Make you fall in my spot  
Since you know all my fault

Anything me like

Act nice every time but the same attitude  
And if you cross our line. Kilamity!

My eyes dey my bill  
Your attention I don't seek  
I like dey at ease  

## Outro  
Anything we want  
We are fit do  
Act nice every time but same attitude
